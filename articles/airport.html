It is the world's busiest airport for <b>Airbus A320</b> aircraft. The under construction expansion program will increase the airport's capacity to handle 100 million passengers by 2030. </p><br>

        <p>2.   domestic airlines have trained their pilots to operate under CAT-II conditions of a minimum 350 m (1,150 ft) visibility. On 31 March 2006, IGI became the first Indian airport to operate two runways simultaneously following a test run involving a <b>SpiceJet</b> plane landing on runway 28 and a <b>JetAirways</b> plane taking off from runway 27 at the same time.</p><br>
        <p>3.   On 21 August 2008, the airport inaugurated its 3rd runway 11/29 costing ₹10 billion[33] and 4,430 m (14,534 ft) long. The runway has one of the world's longest paved threshold displacements of 1,460 m (4,790 ft).</p><br>
